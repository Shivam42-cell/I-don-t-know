    <h1>Dear Khushi Kashyap,</h1>
    <p>I'm truly sorry for every mistake I've made in the past. I know I've hurt you and let you down, and for that, I am deeply sorry. I never intended to cause you pain, and it breaks my heart to think about the times I've disappointed you.</p>
    <p>I love you for your childlike spirit and the joy you bring into my life. Your laughter, your playful nature, and your boundless energy are what make you so special to me. It's those very qualities that make me want to be a better person for you.</p>
    <p>I realize now how much I've taken our friendship for granted, and I want to make amends. I want to start anew, to rebuild the trust and bond that we once had. Please give me a chance to prove to you that I can be the friend you deserve.</p>
    <p>To my dear Don, I'm asking for your forgiveness and another chance to be a part of your life.</p>
    <p>With all my love and sincerity,</p>
    <p><span class="heart">❤</span> Shivam <span class="heart">❤</span></p>
